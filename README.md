# Team 8 Card Game Library

## Description
A library that provides helpful functionality in creating a card game. CardLib handles all of the smaller things like "players" and "cards" so you only have to worry about making the game! For a full list of features, check out the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/janderson2024/card_game_project_1/-/wikis/home).
This project has reached its Minimal Viable Product, and will now be improved through future strech goals.

## Installation
The best way to use this library is to download a zip file of the project. Once the project is on your computer, you can create a game inside the games/ folder to start using the library.

## Dependencies 
**The entire library requires `pygame` to be installed. `pip install pygame`**

- Gin Rummy requires `tqdm` and `numpy` to be installed to play. `pip install tqdm` `pip install numpy`

## Usage
If you are using this just to play the games:
run `python main.py` in the root directory of the project.

If you are using this to create a game:
* create a new python file like {game-name}.py.
* import CardLib.
* define a function called `start_game()` for main to call.
* run `python main.py` and pick your game from the list.
* look through the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/janderson2024/card_game_project_1/-/wikis/home) to lean about all that CardLib has to offer!

## Support
For any bugs, issues, or wanted features: please create an Issue using the Gitlab issue tracker!

## Roadmap
* Merging Card Refactor into version 2.0
